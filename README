C++ implementation of the Iteratively Re-Weighted Least Squares algorithm (IRLS) for generalized linear models (GLM)

** Compile and Test
prerequisite: Gnu scientific library and Gnu g++ compiler

download source code and run make to compile 

To test, generate simulated data by `R --vanilla < gen_data.R`. This script generates a test data file "test.dat" and run it through R (output shown in stdout). To run compiled c++ code: ` ./a.out -d test.dat` the fitted coefficients are displayed.


** Extension to other GLM

For a new link function, create a class mimicking class LogLink. The new class should be inherited from virtual base class "LinkFunc" and implements all required interfaces defined within.
